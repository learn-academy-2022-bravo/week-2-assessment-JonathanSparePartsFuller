# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a data type that you use in a function to allow for a dynamic function. An argument is a value that you pass to the parameter to change the value

  Researched answer: Parameters are like variables that can change depending on the inputed value of the argument. Arguments places whatever data types are given to them into the parameter of a function



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters would be two of the same data types, like two arrays. My understanding is that .map needs to be used in higher order functions whilst utilizing arrays or iterations. I don't know what the optional parameters are but I'll be sure to research the answer.

  Researched answer: Predefined parameters would be functions objects or any primitive data type. An optional parameter would be "this".



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map adds two of the same data types together, while filter removes certain values from a data type and creates a new data type with the removed values.

  Researched answer: Map creates a new array by taking the values of two arrays and puts them together to form a new array. Filter goes through each value of an array and takes out certain ones to create a new array.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A method are shortcuts built into javascript to make coding easier and cleaner for coders, while functions are code strings you build to get a return.

  Researched answer: A function is a piece of reusable code that can called anywhere in the program while a method are actions that can be performed on a object like .map and .filter



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring allows you to break apart an array's value and reassign it to different variables

  Researched answer: Allows you to assign individual array values to variables



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I'm not quite sure what hoisting is, but I'll be sure to find that answer.

  Researched answer: Appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

  I couldn't figure out how to form it into my own words


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: If you have a main class that has basic information but you need to make different classes with more specfic information, you would use class inheritance so you can make multiple classes

2. React: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It can be used for web development, mobile apps, and many other apps

3. React state: Is similar to git status in a way that it checks the current situation of the javascript object used by react

4. React lifecycle methods:There are three categories of lifecycle methods: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Mounting is when a render is first created. Updating takes two arguments and returns a boolean for the original mount. Unmounting is when the object is removed

5. DOM: Document Object Model. DOM basically represents the whole user interface for a app.
